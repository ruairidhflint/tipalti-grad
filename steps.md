Some potentially suggested steps to progress through the challenge:

1. **Fetching Data**: Begin by creating a function dedicated to retrieving data. This function should utilize the built-in [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) or any external library designed for data fetching.

2. **Parsing Data**: Develop a function that processes the fetched data by categorizing it appropriately and calculating the total values for each category.

3. **State Management in Your App**: Within your application, invoke the previously mentioned functions to fetch and parse the data. Then, store this processed data in a state variable using React's [useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) and [useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) hooks for state management and side effects, respectively.

4. **Rendering and Styling**: With the data now stored in your state variable, iterate over it to display each item on the screen. Additionally, apply styling to ensure the data is presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
